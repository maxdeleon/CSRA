# CSRA
CSRA (Cubic Spline Root Algorithm) is a cohort of interpolation schemes and numerical algorithms used as a means for finding roots of approximated functions. Functions that can be approximated can come from a set of raw data, trancendental functions, etc. One the goals of this project is to develop an algorithm that can be optimized for faster execution time, higher precision, or both of the aforementioned. <br />
